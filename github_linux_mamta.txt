1. Installing git on linux:

From your shell, install Git using apt-get:

$ sudo apt-get update

$ sudo apt-get install git

Verify the installation was successful by typing git --version:
$ git --version

2.Configuring git:
$git config -–global user.name “your_username”

$git config -–global user.email “your_emailid”

4.USING GIT
step 1: Go to your github account and create a repository with a name(lets say name of your project). We are creating a repository with the name myproject

step2: Make a folder with the name of your project and change your current directory to that  directory.
$mkdir myproject
$cd myproject

Step 3: Now we want to initiate Git for this folder
$git init

Step 4: Now we will set up the remote, which tells git where the repository is located.

$git remote add origin  https://github.com/your_username/myproject.git
#We have now configured and installed git and, created and configured a repository. Lets say we have a simple file in the myproject folder helloworld.c and we want it to share it with a friend who is working on the same project.

Step 5: To add this file we will type

$git add helloworld.c

Or if we have a lot of files to be transferred from the folder to our git account, then we can use the command.

$git add .
#This would transfer the file(s) in the list which we will later commit.

Step 6: Next, when we are finished adding the files, then we will have to commit adding.

$git commit -m ‘your_message’

NOTE:For further steps there will be authentication needed for that git uses token ,which we have to create from the github website.

Step 7: Next, we need to push the commit that we just made on to the repository at github
$git push https://github.com/mamta298/myproject.git

BASIC COMMANDS:
$git remote -v ->to show the origins
